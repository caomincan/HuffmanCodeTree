# HuffmanCodeTree
This java project is based on Section 5.6 Huffman Coding Tree from book 'Data Structures& Algorithm Analysis in C++',author Clifford A Shaffer. Althroght most file compression applications didn't use Huffman coding tree, this concept is still the heart of file compression techniques. This project is try to impelemnt Huffman Coding Tree then compress any text documents for test.

##Command Line Augments
$ Document -demo
   
It will show the demo tree which is illustrated in book figure 5.24.The relative frequencies for eight selected lettes

| | | | | | | | | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|C|D|E|K|L|M|U|Z|
|32|42|120|7|42|24|37|2|

The codes will be printed out like figure 5.31 in book

|Letter|Freq|Code|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|C|32|1110|
|D|42|101|
|E|120|0|
